# Information Architecture

### Database Choice

- As a framework Django works with SQL databases. During development on my local machine I worked with the standard **sqlite3** database installed with Django.
- On deployment, the SQL database provided by Heroku is a **PostgreSQL** database. 

## Data Models

### User

The User model utilized for this project is the standard one provided by `django.contrib.auth.models`

### Products app model

### Languages
- This project uses:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

# Testing 

- Testing information can be found in every app in the folder "tests", where they separated in to:
    - tests_view
    - tests_models
    - plus one test_unit in checkout app

- To run test simply write in CLI this commands:
    - to run test in all apps write in CLI:
        - python3 manage.py test
    - to run test in desired app write command in CLI:
        - coverage run --source=name of app manage.py test
    - to check coverage write this command in CLI:
        - coverage report
    - to check what tests are missing and display it in html view write command in CLI:
        - coverage html
        
        <br/>

        - you need to open index.html which you will find in htmlcov file that will be auto created after installing coverage 
          in to your IDE. in that file you will be able to see what tests are missing in html view.

- MOST IMPORTANT: in order to run coverage tests you need to install coverage.
    - In order to install coverage write in CLI this command:
        - pip3 install coverage
            - this will generate htmlcov file in your IDE. 

## Code Validation

- I used the [W3C HTML Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTML code.
    - The W3C Validator tool doesn't recognize the Jinja templating, which has resulted in it showing a lot of errors in relation to the Jinja code. However, all other code is validating fine.
- I used the [W3C CSS Validator tool](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate my CSS code.
- I used the [Pep8 Online tool](http://pep8online.com/) to validate my Python syntax.
- I used CLI to sort all my imports by using command  "isort -rc ."
- I used CLI to make sure line length is not going above 79 in one line by using command  "black --line-length=79"
- I used CLI to check all the errors in the code by using command  "flake8"
- I also removed some of the remaining errors manually

## Manual Testing

- I used Google Chrome's Development tools to constantly test each change that I<br/> 
made to my project and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. <br/>
- I also tested my app on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop) to ensure <br/>
it appeared in the desired way on different devices.
- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) - developer tried to use this website to check responsiveness,
however Django has build in protection that does not allow to do it.

## Deployment

I used GitHub for my version control and Heroku to host the live version of my project. To deploy my website to Heroku, I used use the following steps:

1. Created the app in Heroku.
2. Went to the **Resources** tab in Heroku and searched for **Heroku Postgres** in the 'Add-Ons' section.
3. Selected the free **Hobby** level.
4. Updated the `.bashrc` file within my local workspace with the `DATABASE_URL` details, and the `settings.py` to connect to the database using the `dj_database_url` package.
5. Ran the `python3 manage.py makemigrations`, `python3 manage.py migrate`, `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` commands to migrate the models into Heroku Postgres and create a new super user in the new PostgreSQL database.
5. Went to the **Settings** tab in Heroku and clicked on the **Reveal Config Vars** button.
6. Copied and paste all of the default variables from env.py  in to Heroku's Config Vars section.

| Default quote | Your key | 
--- | --- 
os.environ.setdefault | "EMAIL_ADDRESS","your_mail@gmail.com" | 
os.environ.setdefault | EMAIL_PASSWORD", "your_password" | 
os.environ.setdefault | "DATABASE_URL", "postgres://your postgres key, you get it from heroku") | 
os.environ.setdefault | "STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE", "pk_test_your_key_goes_here" | 
os.environ.setdefault | "STRIPE_SECRET", "sk_test_dtripe_key_goes_here" | 
os.environ.setdefault | "SECRET_KEY", "secret_key_goes_here" | 
os.environ.setdefault | "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "access_key_goes_here" | 
os.environ.setdefault | "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY","secret_access_key_goes_here" |  

7. Went to the **Deploy** tab in Heroku, connected my app to my GitHub repository and selected **Enable Automatic Deployment** as the deployment method.
8. Went to the **Developers** section in Stripe and clicked on **API Keys**.
9. Copied and pasted the **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key** and set them as the `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE` and `STRIPE_SECRET` environment variables in the `.bashrc` file within my local workspace.
10. Updated the `settings.py` with the new Stripe environment variables.
11. Went to the **S3** section of AWS and created a new S3 bucket.
12. Updated the `settings.py` file in my local workspace with the relevant S3 bucket details:

    ```
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        "Expires": "Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT",
        "CacheControl": "max-age=94608000",
    }
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = "<s3-bucket-name>"
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = "<region-name>"
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = <access-key-id>
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = <secret-access-key>
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = "%s.s3.amazonaws.com" % AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
    AWS_DEFAULT_ACL = None
    ```
13. Created a `custom_storages.py` file with classes to route to the relevant location settings for static and media files.
14. Updated the `settings.py` file with the relevant configuration for static and media file storage.
15. Ran the `python3 manage.py collectstatic` command to push the static files to my S3 bucket.
16. Created a requirements.txt file using the following command in the terminal window:

    ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt```

17. Created a Procfile using the following command in the terminal window:

    ```web: gunicorn nutristore.wsgi:application> Procfile```

18. Ran the `git add .`, `git commit -m "<commit-message>"` and `git push` commands to push all changes to my GitHub repository.

The app was successfully deployed to Heroku at this stage.

### Live App Link

Click the link below to run my project in the live environment:

[Nutristore](https://nutristore-cygal.herokuapp.com/)

### Repository Link

Click the link below to visit my project's GitHub repository:

[Nutristore GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tomciosegal/nutri-store)

### Running Code Locally

To run my code locally, users can download a local copy of my code to their desktop by completing the following steps:

1. Go to [my GitHub repository]https://github.com/tomciosegal/nutri-store)
2. Click on 'Clone or download' under the repository name.
3. Copy the clone URL for the repository in the 'Clone with HTTPs section'.
4. Open 'Git Bash' in your local IDE.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, then paste the URL you copied in Step 3:

    ```git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY```

7. Press `Enter` to complete the process and create your local clone.
8. Complete one of the two below steps in your local workspace to set your own credentials for the environment variables:
    - Enter and save your own credentials in the `.baschrc` file; or
    - Create a `.env,py` file with your own credentials and import this into the `settings.py` file
9. Install the `requirements.txt` file by running the below command in your CLI Terminal:

    ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

10. Run one of the following commands in your Terminal to launch the Django project:

    ```python3 manage.py runserver```

11. Click the `http://` link that loads, and the project should load. If it doesn't load when you click the link, copy and paste it into a new browser tab instead.
12. Run the following commands to migrate the database models and create a super user:

    ```
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    python3 manage.py migrate
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

13. In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".
14. Set the following config vars in heroku :

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://nutri-store.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/images/config-vars.jpg" alt="TheNutristore github-download" aria-label="Nutristore" />
</div>

<br/>

Once the migrations are completed and the super user has been created successfully, the site should be running locally.

### Media And Static Folders

During development, my `static` and `media` folders weren't pushed to GitHub only in the early parts of the project.
During the progress developer was instructed to keep them in .gitignore file, as they are hosted in my S3 bucket for 
the live version of the site.


  
To allow you to access all functionality on the site locally, ensure you have created free accounts with the following services:
    - [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
    - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [set up an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)
    - [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/)

Please click the links above for documentation on how to set these up and retrieve the necessary environment variables.


### In Gitpod you create env.py file in main directory and write in first line: import os. Use table below to copy required fields.

<br/>


| Default quote | Your key | 
--- | --- 
os.environ.setdefault | "EMAIL_ADDRESS","your_mail@gmail.com" | 
os.environ.setdefault | EMAIL_PASSWORD", "your_password" | 
os.environ.setdefault | "DATABASE_URL", "postgres://your postgres key, you get it from heroku") | 
os.environ.setdefault | "STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE", "pk_test_your_key_goes_here" | 
os.environ.setdefault | "STRIPE_SECRET", "sk_test_dtripe_key_goes_here" | 
os.environ.setdefault | "SECRET_KEY", "secret_key_goes_here" | 
os.environ.setdefault | "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "access_key_goes_here" | 
os.environ.setdefault | "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY","secret_access_key_goes_here" |
